# Hi!I'm Nomusa Mathonsi 

# About me
-As a driven and detail-oriented final-year Diploma in ICT: Applications Development student at Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT), I am passionate about bridging theoretical knowledge with practical innovation. My academic journey has equipped me with expertise in full-stack development, agile methodologies, and modern programming languages like Java, Python, and JavaScript. Through projects such as the Roam Weather Application for tourists and a Java-based car voting system, I have honed my ability to design user-centric solutions while collaborating effectively in team environments. Eager to transition from academia to industry, I am actively seeking an internship opportunity to contribute my technical skills, adaptability, and problem-solving mindset to impactful projects, while further refining my abilities under the mentorship of seasoned professionals
